# Operation Pico

This is a retake of the 1980 tabletop game Operation. The game is played by using a pair of tweezers to remove various objects from the patient's body. If the tweezers touch the metal edges of the object, the buzzer will sound and the player will lose a turn. The player with the most objects removed wins.

## Technologies Used

- Raspberry Pi Pico for the microcontroller (I'm using the Pimoroni Pico Jumbo as it has the nice crocodile clips connectors for the tweezers, speaker and LED for the nose).
- Monk Makes Speaker board for the buzzer.
- 10mm LED for the nose.
- Crocodile clips
